# Google Stitch Design Prompt for Meeting Cost Calculator
## BATCH 2 of 2 (2 Supporting Screens)

## App Overview

Design a modern, professional mobile application UI (iOS/Android) called **Meeting Cost Calculator** - a productivity tool that calculates and displays the real-time cost of meetings to encourage shorter, more efficient meetings.

**Core Purpose**: Create psychological pressure for shorter meetings by prominently displaying costs that count up in real-time, making every second visible and expensive.

**Privacy-First Philosophy**: All data stored locally. No cloud sync, no accounts, no external services. This is a sensitive financial tool handling salary data.

## What to Deliver (BATCH 2 - 2 Screens)

Please design these 2 screens:
1. **Settings Screen**
2. **Welcome/Onboarding Screen**

**Format**: High-fidelity mockups, mobile portrait (iOS/Android), show both light mode designs

**Include**:
- Visual hierarchy examples
- Interactive states (buttons, inputs, toggles)
- Color palette usage examples
- Typography scale in action
- Consider micro-interactions for settings toggles and welcome animations

---

## Special Notes

**Settings Screen**:
- Should feel familiar (like native iOS/Android settings)
- Editable items should be clear
- Privacy messaging should be prominent
- Currency selector should show symbols ($, ‚Ç¨, ¬£, ¬•, Fr) and flags

**Welcome Screen**:
- First impression is critical - must build trust immediately
- Privacy messaging is key differentiator
- Should feel premium and professional
- Clear, single call-to-action
- Don't overcomplicate - keep it simple and welcoming

## Context from Batch 1

You previously designed 6 core screens:
1. Active Meeting Screen (with large cost display)
2. Today Screen (calendar view)
3. Meeting Cost Predictor
4. Employee List
5. Employee Add/Edit Form
6. Meeting History

These 2 screens (Settings and Welcome) should complement that design language and maintain visual consistency.
