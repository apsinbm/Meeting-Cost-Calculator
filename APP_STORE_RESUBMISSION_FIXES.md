# App Store Resubmission Fixes - Version 1.0.10

## Issues Addressed

This resubmission addresses both Apple App Store rejection reasons:

### 1. Issue: 2.3.3 Performance - Accurate Metadata
**Problem**: App metadata in App Store Connect did not accurately describe the app's functionality.

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added comprehensive `description` field in app.json describing all key features
- ✅ Added relevant `keywords` for better discoverability
- ✅ Added `privacy` URL pointing to privacy policy
- ✅ Ensured app name and description match actual functionality

### 2. Issue: 5.1.1 Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage
**Problem**: Privacy practices and data collection not properly disclosed in privacy manifest (required by iOS 17.4+).

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added iOS Privacy Manifest configuration (`privacyManifests`) in app.json
- ✅ Set `NSPrivacyTracking: false` (no user tracking or behavioral data collection)
- ✅ Declared collected data types:
  - Email addresses (optional, used for calendar attendee matching)
  - Employee salary/compensation data (app-specific data)
- ✅ Declared accessed API categories:
  - Calendar access with reason code CA92.1 (calendar functionality)
- ✅ All data marked as NOT linked to user identity
- ✅ All data marked as NOT used for tracking
- ✅ All data purposes clearly stated as "App Functionality Only"

## Key Changes to app.json

   - Use Xcode to inspect Info.plist for privacy keys

   - Generate reports
   - Verify no errors or crashes

4. **Review in App Store Connect**
