# Privacy Policy for Meeting Cost Calculator

**Last Updated:** October 2025

## Overview

Meeting Cost Calculator ("we," "our," or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

## Our Privacy-First Philosophy

**Your data never leaves your device.** Meeting Cost Calculator is designed with privacy as the foundation. All data is stored locally on your device using secure storage mechanisms provided by your mobile operating system (iOS/Android).

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide
- **Employee Data**: Names, roles, email addresses (optional), salary information, bonus amounts, and benefits details
- **Meeting Data**: Meeting titles, dates, times, durations, and attendee information
- **Company Settings**: Company name, preferred currency, and work week hours

### Information We Access
- **Calendar Data**: With your explicit permission, the App reads your device calendar to:
  - Display upcoming meetings
  - Match calendar attendees to employee profiles
  - Pre-calculate meeting costs based on scheduled duration

**Important**: We only READ calendar data. We never write to, modify, or delete calendar events.

## How We Use Your Information

All data is used exclusively for:
- Calculating true employment costs including salary, bonuses, taxes, and benefits
- Tracking meeting costs in real-time
- Generating meeting history and cost reports
- Matching calendar attendees to employee profiles

**We do NOT**:
- Transmit your data to external servers
- Use cloud storage or sync services
- Share your data with third parties
- Use your data for advertising or marketing

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage Only**: All data is stored on your device using AsyncStorage (encrypted by your device's built-in security)
- **Device Encryption**: Your data benefits from iOS/Android device-level encryption

- **No Backups**: Data is not backed up to our servers (it may be included in your device's backup to iCloud/Google Drive if you have device backup enabled)

## Email Reports

When you generate an email report:
- The report is created on your device
- Your device's native email app is opened with a pre-filled message
- You control who receives the report
- The email is sent from YOUR email account, not through our servers
- We never see or store the email addresses you send reports to
